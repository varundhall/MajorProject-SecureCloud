                                <p>Cloud Computing is the primitive change happening in the field of Information Technology. 
                                    It uses the internet technologies for delivery of IT - enabled capabilities 'as a service' to any needed users. 
                                    Cloud computing enables users to access resources using internet, from anywhere at any time without worrying 
                                    about technical/physical management and maintenance concernof the original resources. In its description for cloud 
                                    characteristics The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines as cloud characteristics the following:
                                    On-demand self-service, Ubiquitous network access, Resource pooling, Rapid elasticity (resources can be scaled up and 
                                    down easily), Metered service (resources' usage is measured) and Pay-as-you-Consume business models. Google Apps is 
                                    an important example of Cloud computing, it enables to access services through the browser and brought into effective 
                                    action on millions of machines over the Internet.One of the most prominent service offered by cloud computing is cloud 
                                    storage. Cloud storage is simply a term that refers to on line space that you can use to store your data. In more strict
                                    way, cloud storage is a service model 
                                    in which data is maintained, managed and backed up remotely and made available to users over a network.</p>

                                    <strong>Software as a service (SaaS) </strong><br/>
                                    The cloud provider deploys, configures, maintains and updates the operation of the 
                                    software applications on a cloud infrastructure so that the services are provisioned
                                    at the expected service levels to cloud consumers. The cloud consumers have limited
                                    administrative control of the applications.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Platform as a service (PaaS) </strong><br/>
                                    The Cloud Provider manages the computing infrastructure for the platform and runs 
                                    the cloud software that provides the components of the platform, such as runtime 
                                    software execution stack, databases, and other middleware components. The PaaS Cloud
                                    Provider typically also supports the development, deployment and management process 
                                    of the PaaS Cloud Consumer by providing tools such as integrated development 
                                    environments (IDEs), development version of cloud software, software development kits 
                                    (SDKs), deployment and management tools.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</strong><br/>
                                    The Cloud Provider acquires the physical computing resources underlying the service, 
                                    including the servers, networks, storage and hosting infrastructure. The Cloud 
                                    Provider runs the cloud software necessary to makes computing resources available
                                    to the IaaS Cloud Consumer through a set of service interfaces and computing resource
                                    abstractions, such as virtual machines and virtual network interfaces.
